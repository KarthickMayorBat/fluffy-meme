This project is made of jsp, servlet, mysql and javascript with NETBEANS RC IDE. And i have included a ReadME document which shows the database and the project looks on it. Created tables using workbench mysql.
U can download the zip file and refer to the word document first and then go to the web for accessing the codes and you can modify it according to your project.
And use netbeans to open the project, and i have created more files with more ideas which is not implemented in this project but i have attached those too. So feel free to look those and try to connect it if you want. Thank you :)
